    dareal.legacy is a D port of DaRealJS.

    DaRealJS has been written in C# and relies on Bridge.NET (transpiles to JS).
    It is a drawing and timing library for game development and was developed
    as part of a school project. Some parts of it have been designed cheaply.
    Unfortunately, this was necessary for time reasons.

    DaRealJS credits:
        + development
            + Zake (Lukas Aufmesser)
            + 0xEAB (Elias Batek)
        + testing:
            + Kio20 (Bernhard Kornberger)
